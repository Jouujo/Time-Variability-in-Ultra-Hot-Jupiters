# Atmospheric Variability Analysis of WASP-121b ðŸŒŒ

This repository presents my research on simulating and analyzing the atmospheric dynamics of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b using the **MIT General Circulation Model (MITgcm)**. This work was completed as part of the **GRAD-MAP Summer 2025 Program** at the University of Maryland, Department of Astronomy and Physics, in College Park, Maryland under Dr. Hayley Beltz, a post-doctoral associate at UMD.

## Overview

We used a customized version of MITgcmâ€”originally developed for Earthâ€™s climate systemsâ€”to investigate temperature variability in WASP-121bâ€™s atmosphere. I developed Python-based post-processing tools to extract, clean, visualize, and analyze multi-dimensional simulation output data, exploring how temperature and wind patterns evolve over time and space.

I will continue this work independently during the academic year under the mentorship of **Dr. Hayley Beltz**.

## Objectives

- Simulate atmospheric behavior using MITgcm on ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b
- Edit historic MATLAB model code to go over a range of timesteps
- Quantify temperature variability across longitude, latitude, pressure levels, and planetary time
- Build reusable post-processing pipelines in Python for scientific visualization

---

## Key Features

- **Atmospheric Data Extraction**: Converted and built scripts to process model outputs
- **Visualization**: Plots of temperature fields, standard deviation vs. pressure/time/coordinates
- **Automation**: Automated slice extraction across time/space dimensions
- **Planetary Context**: Interpreted results in light of planetary rotation and irradiation dynamics

## About WASP-121b

- Orbits extremely close (~0.025 AU) to its host star
- Surface temperatures exceed 2,500K
- Ideal for atmospheric studies due to extreme irradiation and brightness
